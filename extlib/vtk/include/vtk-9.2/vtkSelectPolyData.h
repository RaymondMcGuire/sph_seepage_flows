/**
 * @class   vtkSelectPolyData
 * @brief   select portion of polygonal mesh; generate selection scalars
 *
 * vtkSelectPolyData is a filter that selects polygonal data based on
 * defining a "loop" and indicating the region inside of the loop. The
 * mesh within the loop consists of complete cells (the cells are not
 * cut). Alternatively, this filter can be used to generate scalars.
 * These scalar values, which are a distance measure to the loop, can
 * be used to clip, contour. or extract data (i.e., anything that an
 * implicit function can do).
 *
 * The loop is defined by an array of x-y-z point coordinates.
 * (Coordinates should be in the same coordinate space as the input
 * polygonal data.) The loop can be concave and non-planar, but not
 * self-intersecting. The input to the filter is a polygonal mesh
 * (only surface primitives such as triangle strips and polygons); the
 * output is either a) a portion of the original mesh laying within
 * the selection loop (GenerateSelectionScalarsOff); or b) the same
 * polygonal mesh with the addition of scalar values
 * (GenerateSelectionScalarsOn).
 *
 * The algorithm works as follows. For each point coordinate in the
 * loop, the closest point in the mesh is found. The result is a loop
 * of closest point ids from the mesh. Then, the edges in the mesh
 * connecting the closest points (and laying along the lines forming
 * the loop) are found. Edges between the points can be searched using
 * one of these methods:
 * A) Greedy edge tracking.
 * At the current point, the mesh edge oriented in the
 * direction of and whose end point is closest to the line is
 * chosen. The edge is followed to the new end point, and the
 * procedure is repeated. This process continues until the entire loop
 * has been created. This method is simple and fast but heuristic,
 * and edge search can randomly fail ("Can't follow edge" error)
 * even for simple, flawless meshes when edge search arrives to a point
 * from where there is no edge pointing towards the next loop point.
 * B) Dijkstra shortest path. This method guarantees to find the shortest
 * path between the loop points.
 *
 * By default the greedy edge tracking method is used to preserve
 * backward compatibility, but generally the Dijkstra shortest path
 * method is recommended due to its robustness.
 *
 * To determine what portion of the mesh is inside and outside of the
 * loop, three options are possible. 1) the smallest connected region,
 * 2) the largest connected region, and 3) the connected region
 * closest to a user specified point. (Set the ivar SelectionMode.)
 *
 * Once the loop is computed as above, the GenerateSelectionScalars
 * controls the output of the filter. If on, then scalar values are
 * generated based on distance to the loop lines. Otherwise, the cells
 * laying inside the selection loop are output. By default, the mesh
 * laying within the loop is output; however, if InsideOut is on, then
 * the portion of the mesh laying outside of the loop is output.
 *
 * The filter can be configured to generate the unselected portions of
 * the mesh as output by setting GenerateUnselectedOutput. Use the
 * method GetUnselectedOutput to access this output. (Note: this flag
 * is pertinent only when GenerateSelectionScalars is off.)
 *
 * @warning
 * Make sure that the points you pick are on a connected surface. If
 * not, then the filter will generate an empty or partial result. Also,
 * self-intersecting loops will generate unpredictable results.
 *
 * @warning
 * During processing of the data, non-triangular cells are converted to
 * triangles if GenerateSelectionScalars is off.
