/**
 * @class   vtkStaticPointLocator
 * @brief   quickly locate points in 3-space
 *
 * vtkStaticPointLocator is a spatial search object to quickly locate points
 * in 3D.  vtkStaticPointLocator works by dividing a specified region of
 * space into a regular array of cuboid buckets, and then keeping a
 * list of points that lie in each bucket. Typical operation involves giving
 * a position in 3D and finding the closest point; or finding the N closest
 * points.
 *
 * vtkStaticPointLocator is an accelerated version of vtkPointLocator. It is
 * threaded (via vtkSMPTools), and supports one-time static construction
 * (i.e., incremental point insertion is not supported). If you need to
 * incrementally insert points, use the vtkPointLocator or its kin to do so.
 *
 * @warning
 * This class is templated. It may run slower than serial execution if the code
 * is not optimized during compilation. Build in Release or ReleaseWithDebugInfo.
 *
 * @warning
 * Make sure that you review the documentation for the superclasses
 * vtkAbstactPointLocator and vtkLocator. In particular the Automatic
 * data member can be used to automatically determine divisions based
 * on the average number of points per bucket.
 *
 * @warning
 * Other types of spatial locators have been developed such as octrees and
 * kd-trees. These are often more efficient for the operations described
 * here.
 *
 * @warning
 * Frequently vtkStaticPointLocator is used in lieu of vtkPointLocator.
 * They are very similar in terms of algorithmic approach, however
 * vtkStaticCellLocator is threaded and is typically much faster for
 * a large number of points (on the order of 3-5x faster). For small numbers
 * of points, vtkPointLocator is just as fast as vtkStaticPointLocator.
