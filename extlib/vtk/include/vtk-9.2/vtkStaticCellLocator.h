/**
 * @class   vtkStaticCellLocator
 * @brief   perform fast cell location operations
 *
 * vtkStaticCellLocator is a type of vtkAbstractCellLocator that accelerates
 * certain operations when performing spatial operations on cells. These
 * operations include finding a point that contains a cell, and intersecting
 * cells with a line.
 *
 * vtkStaticCellLocator is an accelerated version of vtkCellLocator. It is
 * threaded (via vtkSMPTools), and supports one-time static construction
 * (i.e., incremental cell insertion is not supported).
 *
 * @warning
 * vtkStaticCellLocator utilizes the following parent class parameters:
 * - Automatic                   (default true)
 * - NumberOfCellsPerNode        (default 10)
 * - UseExistingSearchStructure  (default false)
 *
 * vtkStaticCellLocator does NOT utilize the following parameters:
 * - CacheCellBounds             (always cached)
 * - Tolerance
 * - Level
 * - MaxLevel
 * - RetainCellLists
 *
 * @warning
 * This class is templated. It may run slower than serial execution if the code
 * is not optimized during compilation. Build in Release or ReleaseWithDebugInfo.
