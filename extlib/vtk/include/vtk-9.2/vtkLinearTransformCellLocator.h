/**
 * @class   vtkLinearTransformCellLocator
 * @brief   Cell locator adaptor to perform cell Location on datasets that are a linear
 * transformation of the original dataset.
 *
 * vtkLinearTransformCellLocator is a cell locator adaptor that can accept any cell locator, e.g.
 * vtkStaticCellLocator, vtkCellLocator, calculate the transformation matrix from the cell
 * locator adaptor's dataset to the given dataset inside BuildLocator, and then use the cell locator
 * and transformation to perform cell locator operations. The transformation matrix is computed
 * using the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabsch_algorithm. UseAllPoints allows you to compute the
 * transformation using all the points of the dataset (use that when you are not sure if it's a
 * linear transformation) or 100 sample points (or less if the dataset is smaller) that are chosen
 * every-nth. IsLinearTransformation validates if the dataset is a linear transformation of the cell
 * locator's dataset based on the used points.
 *
 * @warning The cell locator adaptor MUST be built before using it.
 *
 * vtkLinearTransformCellLocator does NOT utilize ANY vtkLocator/vtkAbstractCellLocator parameter:
