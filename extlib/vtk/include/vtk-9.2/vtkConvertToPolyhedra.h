/**
 * @class   vtkConvertToPolyhedra
 * @brief   convert 3D linear cells to vtkPolyhedra
 *
 * vtkConvertToPolyhedra is a filter that takes a vtkUnstructuredGrid as
 * input and produces a vtkUnstructuredGrid on output, converting 3D linear
 * cells such as tetrahedra, hexahedra, wedges, and pyramids into
 * vtkPolyhedron.
 *
 * @warning
 * Certain cells are skipped and not converted, this includes cells of dimension
 * two or less (e.g., triangles, quads, lines, verts, and so on); and higher
 * order cells that cannot easily be converted to vtkPolyhedra. (TODO: tessellate
 * high-order 3D cell faces and then use these to form the polyhedra.)
 *
 * @warning
 * This filter is typically used for testing. In general, processing linear cells
 * is preferrable to processing polyhedra due to differences in speed of processing,
 * and memory requirements.
