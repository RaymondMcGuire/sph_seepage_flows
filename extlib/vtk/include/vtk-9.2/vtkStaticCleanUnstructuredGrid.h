/**
 * @class   vtkStaticCleanUnstructuredGrid
 * @brief   merge duplicate points, removed unused points, in an vtkUnstructuredGrid
 *
 * vtkStaticCleanUnstructuredGrid is a filter that takes a
 * vtkUnstructuredGrid as input and produces a vtkUnstructuredGrid on output,
 * merging coincident points (as defined by a merging tolerance) and
 * optionally removing unused points. The filter does not modify the topology
 * of the input dataset, nor change the types of cells. It may however,
 * renumber the cell connectivity ids.
 *
 * For better performance, this filter employs threading using
 * vtkStaticPointLocator and its associated threaded methods. When the
 * merging tolerances==0.0, execution speeds are much faster as compared to
 * non-zero tolerances. When the merging tolerance > 0.0, there are issues
 * of processing order which can be controlled through the locator
 * (returned via GetLocator()). This behavior can be controlled by the
 * SetTraversalOrder() method - by default threading occurs via BIN_ORDER
 * (see vtkStaticPointLocator for more information).
 *
 * @warning
 * Merging points can alter cell geometry and produce degenerate cells. The
 * tolerance should be chosen carefully to avoid these problems. For example,
 * in an extreme case with a relatively large tolerance, all points of a
 * vtkHexahedron could be merged to a single point, in which case the
 * resulting hexahedron would be defined by eight repeats of the same point.
 *
 * @warning
 * If RemoveUnusedPoints is enabled, then any point not used by any of the
 * unstructured grid cells is eliminated (and not passed to the
 * output). Enabling this feature does impact performance.
 *
 * @warning
 * If ProduceMergeMap is enabled, then an output data array is produced,
 * associated with the output field data, that maps each input point to an
 * output point (or to -1 if an input point is unused in the output).
 *
 * @warning
 * Merging points affects point coordinates and data attributes. By default,
 * if points are merged, the point position and attribute data of only one
 * point (i.e., the point that all other points are merged to) is
 * retained. If AveragePointData is enabled, then the resulting point position
 * and attribute data values are determined by averaging the position and
 * attribute values of all the points that are merged together. This option
 * may have a significant performance impact if enabled.
 *
 * @warning
 * This class has been threaded with vtkSMPTools. Using TBB or other
 * non-sequential type (set in the CMake variable
 * VTK_SMP_IMPLEMENTATION_TYPE) may improve performance significantly.
