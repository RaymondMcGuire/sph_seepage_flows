/**
 * @class   vtkHyperTreeGridMapper
 * @brief   map vtkHyperTreeGrid to graphics primitives

 * vtkHyperTreeGridMapper is a class that maps polygonal data (i.e., vtkHyperTreeGrid)
 * to graphics primitives. vtkHyperTreeGridMapper serves as a superclass for
 * device-specific poly data mappers, that actually do the mapping to the
 * rendering/graphics hardware/software.

 * By default, this class use an Adaptive GeometryFilter that extract only
 * the part of the geometry to render. Be careful as this implies that new
 * render my trigger an update of the pipeline to get the new part of the
 * geometry to render.

 * Note: this class has its own module to avoid cyclic dependency between Rendering Core
 * and Filters Hybrid
 * * It need Filters Hybrid for Adaptive2DGeometryFilter
 * * Filters Hybrid need Rendering Core because of Adaptive2DGeometryFilter
